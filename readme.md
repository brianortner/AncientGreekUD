# Ancient Greek texts automatically parsed using the model ancient_greek-ud-2.0-170801 in UDPipe 

This repository contains texts which have been parsed using the UDPipe API at:

http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe/api-reference.php

I have given as an input the already tokenized texts available at:

https://github.com/gcelano/LemmatizedAncientGreekXML/tree/master/texts

The UDPipe json output has then been converted into the conllu format. 
Note that not all the texts available at the above link could be parsed,
because they were too large and UDPipe rejected the requests.
